Say you're working on a project...

After typing out a few initial lines of code you decide this is worth making into a Git repository. 

Go to the directory that you are thinking of making a repository out of and type

git init

This creates the tools that Git needs to track changes.
Three steps of a Git project are:
a. Working Directory where files are edited, and organized.
b. Staging Area where the changes to the working directory are listed.
c. Repository where the final changes are reflected.

git status to see changes in the Git project.

Now, to add the untracked files to the staging area with command:

git add filename

This sends the file to the staging area.

git diff filename

will give the changes between the working and the staged file. 

Finally, commit this with

git commit -m " //message in present tense, 50 words"

List of the various commits can be seen with 

git log

The commit we are on, is called the HEAD commit. To actually see it:

git show HEAD

Press q to exit the commit log mode.

To remove the changes made in the very last commit

git checkout HEAD filename

git reset HEAD filename 

to reset the staging area
